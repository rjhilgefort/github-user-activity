# Charter React Challenge

Thank you for taking part in the Charter React coding challenge!

The goal is simple: we've handed you a basic set of components that display a raw list of GitHub repos owned by a
specific user, you make it functional.

How you define functional is entirely up to you. Make it sortable, filterable, styled up nice, interactive, whatever --
ball's in your court. Feel free to change anything and everything you see in this repository as you see fit.

Bonus points for careful consideration of both testing strategies and modularity with regard to both component design
and repository structure.

Have fun -- we look forward to seeing what you come up with!

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)._
